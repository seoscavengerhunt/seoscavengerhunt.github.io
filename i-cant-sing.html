                    <h3>The canonical is the URL of the original source of the content</h3>
										<p>Canonicals are a way of telling Google where the orginating page is.  If Google sees that Airbnb has a /s/SF page and a /s/San-Francisco--CA page, and we don't have a canonical set, it'll start ranking both of these pages.  What happens is that these pages then start competing with each other for the same set of keywords, because both of those pages contain identical content. That's why we have a canonical URL, this tells Google which page is the true source of the content. It's one of the most important SEO infrastructure elements that you can implement. Especially when you have a large programmatically generated website.</p>
                    <p>I was pulled into helping out with the Plus launch at the last minte(we're talking like 6pm the night before launch). I worked with Judy Jow to get all the tags/SEO changes in the night before.  I thought everything was going well until I got a message from Judy while I was on the bus going to The Masonic, telling me that we still needed to submit the pages to the Google index.</p>
                    <p>Google has been preaching to SEO for YEARS that everything should be mobile first, and that your website should be responsive or else you'd start dropping in the rankings because of usability problems.  Well Google, I'd strongly suggest you make Google Search Console responsive, because trying to log onto Google Search Console, navigating the tiny UI and submitting pages on my phone while on the bus was way harder than it should have been.</p>
                    <p>Product launches with SEO is difficult. The hard part is that you need to be ranking for your keyword, but you don't want anyone discovering your page/product before launch. Google takes a bit of time index and rank it as well.  This makes it especially trying when you're a higher profile company like Airbnb and need to make sure that things are kept under wraps. Submit the pages to the index too early and someone will find out, waiting until the last minute means that your page might not appear.</p>
