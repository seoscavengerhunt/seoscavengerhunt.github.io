It's hard to encapsulate the last two and a half years that I've spent here. Working here has been one of the most terrifying, eye-opening, illuminating and downright rewarding things that I've ever done. There are too many people to thank among the multitudes of products and projects that I've worked on, so I'll try and keep the shoutouts to a minimum.

I stumbled into the world of SEO by accident, and never thought that it would lead me to where I am today.  I would never have imagined that I'd be helping out with a Superbowl commercial two days before it aired, or that Google would fly Gil and I out to Amsterdam to give a talk at a conference. To call the last two years a whirlpool of emotions would be an understatement, and I wouldn't have been able to keep it up without the help of everyone that's been on the SEO team and the OMG team.
