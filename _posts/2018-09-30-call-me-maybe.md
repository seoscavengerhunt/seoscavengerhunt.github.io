[Part 1](https://seoloveletter.github.io/letter/clueless) [Part 2](https://seoloveletter.github.io/letter/i-have-no-idea)

The SEO team here is a world class team, and I don't use that term lightly. Other companies have teams of people that are dedicated to just SEO, we're not talking SEO specialists, engineers and data scientists that make up the SEO team.  Companies have teams of 10-20 people that are just SEO specialists.  Airbnb's SEO team is nowhere near that size. We don't have a team of SEO specialists, we don't have people that have spent their entire lives doing SEO.  **That's because we don't need to.** Every engineer/data science/researcher/designer that is on the SEO team is better at SEO than 99% of the SEOs that I've met. Every person on the SEO team is not only one of the best at their job function, they're also a top-tier SEO.

All of the amazing things that I've experienced was thanks to Airbnb, and I cannot express the amount of love that I have for the company, for the people I've worked with and the friendships that were forged. It's with an immensely heavy heart that I'm leaving this place, but SEO will continue to live on in this company. Not a week goes by where I don't receive Slack messages and e-mails about how to do SEO for a specific business function, or to teach a team what SEO is and how they could use it to help support them. For me, that's a great thing to happen. I am so unbelievably happy that people at this company care about SEO and want to do everything they can to make it better.

One of my biggest regrets is that I wish I had done a better job teaching everyone in the company how to do SEO. That's why I decided to use this goodbye website as one last platform to teach everyone the absolute basics on how to do SEO. Hopefully you'll take the time to complete the [challenges](https://seoloveletter.github.io/start).  I'll drop memories, funny stories and helpful lessons along the way to stop you from getting too bored.  If you need help, feel free to ping me on Slack(while I'm still available) or drop by the #seoloveletter channel for a hint. It shouldn't take any longer than 10 minutes. I will say that Step 1 is probably the hardest step, everything else should be cake.
