										<h3>Title tags are the easiest SEO tag to update and have a huge effect on the page.</h3>
									</header>
									<p>You can think of title tags as what sets the topic for the page. You'll want to throw in the correct keywords that you want your page to rank for. In the case of this website, I totally cheated and wanted to rank for a keyword that didn't exist "myseoloveletter". So that was immensely easy to rank for. Make sure your title tags are targeting a unique keyword space that isn't being targeted elsewhere on the website.</p>
                  <p>Working on the Superbowl commerical was one of the craziest things that I've ever touched at Airbnb. Tommy and I were told on a Friday at 5:30 that Airbnb would be showing a Superbowl commercial and they would need help to make sure that their page showed up for the keyword #weaccept. I don't think I've seen a more motivated group of employees come together and bang out an entire microsite in such a short period of time. I remember telling my mom that I was working on it and she of course wanted to see the commercial on Superbowl Sunday. She did tell me after that the commerical was really short and that she watched the entire Superbowl through, just in case the commercial was played more than once.</p>
