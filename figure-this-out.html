										<h3>Androids dream of electric sheep and robots read the robots.txt</h3>

									<p>The robots.txt is a file that you place on the root of your website.  It tells search engines where it can go and where it isn't allowed to go. It's quite an important file, if you configure it wrong, you'll tell Google to stop crawling your website. It's also an effective tool to stop Google from crawling pages on your website that don't matter and/or don't drive meaningful traffic.</p>
                  <p>If you were at Macy's and wanted to run an experiment, you'd have to wait 3-4 months before they could run an experiment for you. Coming in to Airbnb and interviewing, I had no experience with experimentation. This was made painfully clear when I interviewed with Lilei. If you've never interacted with Lilei before, she's a data scientist, and is quite possibly the smartest person I've ever interacted with.</p>
                  <p>So you can imagine what happened when I interviewed with Lilei.  I was the one that foolishly brought up how I would want to run an SEO title tag experiment. I can't really remember what happened next, but I do remember thinking that I was an idiot for bringing this up and that I knew absolutely nothing. Especially when she started asking me questions.  I'm also pretty sure she said something about Bayesian time series, beta distribution, incrementality, p-values and whether or not I even knew how to run an experiment.  I would later find out that Lilei designed our SEO experimentation platform, and that I was, in fact an idiot, for bringing it up. In all seriousness, Lilei was a joy to interview with, and gently guided me along until I was able to come up with a half-baked answer for her.
